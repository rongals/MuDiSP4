     Model from Wang Giannakis "Wireless Multicarrier Comm"

This model provides a general framework for OFDM-based wireless
communications. It is derived from the work from Wang-Giannakis
adapted to a general representation of more recent wireless 
standards. The set of multiple access schemes which can be 
represented with this model are:

OFDMA
CDMA
MC-CDMA
SC-FDMA

The represented environment is a set of M transmitters and M
receivers, with MxM wide set of time-domain impulse responses
representing many of the possible SISO/MIMO combinations of a 
reference systems. Depending on the relative location of the
receivers and transmitters, the following situation can be 
modeled:

Uplink for a cellular system
(rx co-located at basestation and tx scattered around)

Downlink for a cellular system
(tx co-located at BS and rx scattered)

MIMO systems
(tx and rx grouped)
